The Multi-Language Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis Dataset for COVID-19 Tweets
This dataset contains the unlabeled tweet IDs and labeled tweets and Weibo used for sentimental analysis about Covid-19. The labeled tweets were organized in three languages (English and Arabic both with 10K and Chinese Weibo with about 22K) while the unlabeled tweet IDs were represented with only IDs to comply with Twitterâ€™s Terms of Service and Weibo's Terms of Service in six languages (English, Arabic, Spanish, French, and Italian in Tweets and Chinese in Weibo data). In order to make use of the labeled data as much as possible, we utilize Google translate(https://translate.google.com/) to translate the labeled English tweets into Spanish, French, and Italian. The translated tweets are in good quality after a large number of observations. The twitter data was collected from March 1, 2020 with Twint(https://github.com/twintproject/twint) while the Weibo data was collected from January 10. These data is only released for non-commercial research use.
